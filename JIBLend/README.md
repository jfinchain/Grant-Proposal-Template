## Relevant usage metrics:

(TVL, transactions, volume, unique addresses, etc. JIBChain metrics preferred; please link to public sources such as Dune Analytics, etc.):

- Total Value Locked (TVL): Measure the total value of assets locked within the JIBLend protocol. TVL is a key indicator of the platform's overall adoption and user trust.
- Liquidity Providers (LPs): Track the number of users providing liquidity to the JIBLend platform. Increasing LPs indicates a growing community of lenders supporting the protocol.
- Borrowers and Loan Volume: Monitor the number of borrowers utilizing JIBLend and the total volume of loans issued. A rising number of borrowers and loan volume reflect the platform's attractiveness for those seeking liquidity.
- Interest Rates and APY: Analyze the interest rates offered to lenders and the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) for borrowers. Stable and competitive interest rates attract users and contribute to the platform's stability.
- Transaction Volume: Track the overall transaction volume on the JIBLend platform. An increasing transaction volume signifies a vibrant ecosystem with active lending and borrowing activities.
- User Retention Rate: Measure the percentage of users who continue to use JIBLend over time. A high retention rate indicates a satisfied user base and the platform's ability to meet user expectations.
- Security Audits and Vulnerability Reports: Regularly assess the security status of JIBLend through third-party audits and monitor any vulnerability reports. A low number of vulnerabilities and successful audits enhance user trust.
- Governance Participation: Gauge the level of community involvement in the governance of JIBLend. High participation in voting and decision-making processes indicates an engaged and empowered user community.
