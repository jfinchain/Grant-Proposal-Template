## Proposal for token distribution:

-3 NFT Rewards Pool = 27.38 JBC (perday)
-2 LP Rewards Pool = 18.25 JBC (perday)
-4 LP Token Supply = Liquidity up 2x-3x

How will the JBC tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.)
-50% is reward pools.
-50% is to place an LP.

Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.
-Plan distribute it all in 3 years.

Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on JIBChain. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should be trackable.
