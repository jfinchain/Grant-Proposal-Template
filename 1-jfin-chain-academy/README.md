## Ecosystem Value Proposition:

What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Jfinchain ecosystem?
- JFIN Chain is new and has very few use cases.
- The entry wall of new blockchain network is high. People have no idea what to do to start using it.

How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?
- Lower the entry wall, increase the amount of developer on JFIN Chain. Thus, increase the use cases on JFIN Chain.

Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Jfinchain ecosystem?
- Blockchain is actualy quite easy to work with, but right now very few people share that knowledge in Thai language. 
The founding JFIN Chain academy will attract a lot of developers who previously has now idea about the Blockchain, to start using JFIN Chain as their first Blockchain network.

- Since this is actually the first proposal ever for the JFIN grant program: **No**.

## How much will your project match in co-incentives? 
(not required but recommended, when applicable): none

## Proposal for token distribution:

How will the JFIN tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.)
Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.
Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Jfinchain. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should be trackable.
Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Jfinchain remain after incentives dry up?
Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.)

The Budget is 30,000 JFIN per year or 2,500 JFIN monthly. 
- 2,000 JFIN will be paid to speakers (2-3 person, up to 1,000 JFIN each)
- 300 JFIN for students (60 person, 5 JFIN each) 
- 200 JFIN for Project Management, Marketing and Public Relations.
