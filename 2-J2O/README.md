## Grant category: 
- [ ] DeFi
- [ ] NFT
- [ ] Tooling
- [x] Other (Blockchain Execution Layer)

## Project description (please explain how your project works):
 Make an execution layer for JFIN Chain. Increasing the throughput of the transaction from hundreds transactions per second to thousands transactions per second. This will allow the utilization of blockchain for real-world use cases. For example: Voucher generation, Concert ticket. Which normaly impossible due to low throughput of consensus layer (L1) of the blockchain.

## Project links:

* Will be announce once the proposal has been granted

## Additional team member info (please link):
none

## Please link to any previous projects the team has meaningfully contributed to:
- [JFIN Chain (Layer1)](https://jfinchain.com/)

## Relevant usage metrics 
Can create 2,000 NFTs in single transaction.

## Competitors, peers, or similar projects 
(please link): unknown

## Is/will this project be open sourced? 
- [x] Yes
- [ ] No

## Date of deployment/expected deployment on JFIN Chain:
- Within 2 weeks after the proposal granted

## Ecosystem Value Proposition:

What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Jfinchain ecosystem?
- JFIN Chain is consensus layer and has low throughput, under 300 transactions per second.
- J2O will serve as a execution layer for JFIN Chain.
- J2O will has minimum of 1,000 transactions per second while the transaction fee is lower (configurable).

How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?
- This will allow the utilization of blockchain for real-world use cases. For example: Voucher generation, Concert ticket. Which normaly impossible due to low throughput of consensus layer (L1) of the blockchain.

Why will this solution be a source of growth for the Jfinchain ecosystem?
- Thailand SEC will allow the usage of utility token soon. This will allow the usage of using blockchain as a representative of real-world asset. E.g. Voucher, tickets.
- There are not available layer2 blockchain in Thailand. J2O will be the first. 
- That's mean, there are demands for using blockchain from SEC annoucement, but no supply at all. We can take this advantage and capture all the marketshare.

Has your project previously applied for an JFIN grant? If successful, please link to your previous grant proposal and provide a brief update on milestones achieved with the grant. If unsuccessful, and this is a resubmission, please specify how you have incorporated significant changes in accordance with feedback.
- has sent 1 proposal before, JFIN Chain Academy. Still pending. 
- The answer is: **No**.

## Number of JFIN tokens requested:

200,000 JFIN for liquidity once and additional 20,000 JFIN per year for development fee. Contract yearly.

For example:
1st year: requires 220,000 JFIN.
2nd year: requires 20,000 JFIN.
3rd year: requires 20,000 JFIN.
4th year: requires 20,000 JFIN.

Please note that the initial 200,000 JFIN may be depleted at anytime depends on the popularity of the blockchain. If depleted, it required JFIN Chain to provide more liquidity fund for the continuation of usage.

## Did the project apply for or receive JFIN tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?:
- [ ] Yes
- [x] No (Individual)

## If JFIN tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?:
- none

## How much will your project match in co-incentives? 
(not required but recommended, when applicable): none

## Proposal for token distribution:

How will the JFIN tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.)
Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.
Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Jfinchain. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should be trackable.
Why will incentivized users and liquidity on Jfinchain remain after incentives dry up?
Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.)
