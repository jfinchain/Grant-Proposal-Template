## Ecosystem Value Proposition:

What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the JIBChain ecosystem?
-Marketing

How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?
-Create real-world applications that is not illegal

Why will this solution be a source of growth for the JIBChain ecosystem?
-Tangible activities It can reach many people. When a large number of people have access It can grow up.

Has your project previously applied for an JBC grant? If successful, please link to your previous grant proposal and provide a brief update on milestones achieved with the grant. If unsuccessful, and this is a resubmission, please specify how you have incorporated significant changes in accordance with feedback.
-We have never applied for funding from JBC.

## Number of JBC tokens requested: 150,000 JBC
LP Token SupplyWar 5,000,000/50,000 JBC 
LP Token Angel blessing 1,000,000 / 100,000 JBC

## Did the project apply for or receive JBC tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?:
No

## If JBC tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?:
I don't know because we will use all of JBC to place the LP to make the project happen.

## How much will your project match in co-incentives? 
(not required but recommended, when applicable):There is a high chance because our project has already happened in the real world. All that remains is to connect with chains in the NFT and Defi world, so working with JBC is a non-starter. But it is about supporting growth. that can be mutually beneficial.

## Proposal for token distribution:

13,700 SupplyWar = 137 JBC  (perday)
2,730 Angel blessing = 273 JBC (perday)

How will the JBC tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.) 
-100% is to place an LP/Project Token as a reward in the GameFi.

Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.
-We aim to distribute it all in 2 years.

Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on JIBChain. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should be trackable.
Why will incentivized users and liquidity on JIBChain remain after incentives dry up?
-All Starter NFT 500 piece sold out

Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.)
