## How much will your project match in co-incentives? 
(not required but recommended, when applicable):


## Proposal for token distribution: JBC will bridge and place LP on Diamon.finance alongside CMM Token (KJBC/CMM), which CMM already has LP with KKUB. This will encourage JBC to have more use cases and users can join the JIB Chain ecosystem through KKUB.

How will the JIB tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.)
How will the JBC tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.)
Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.
Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on JIBchain. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should be trackable.
Why will incentivized users and liquidity on JIBchain remain after incentives dry up?
Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:(smart contracts addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.)
